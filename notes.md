## Bugs
### fix glitchy card hover on scroll
- hover over cards is glitchy when hovering at the edge
- position of element moves back and forth triggering hover on/off

Potential Causes:

Info
- https://www.sitepoint.com/community/t/glitchy-hover-animation-and-animations-running-on-load/325015/2 
- "Of course it will be glitchy because as soon as you hover over the element you move it out of the way which means its no longer hovered and the animation stops. The cycle is then repeated ad infinitum "
-  Also avoid using position to move things as that causes a reflow. 
- Itâ€™s much better to use translate where possible.

Solution:
- use transform: translate() instead of position
- this works bc transform doesn't change the flow of the element
